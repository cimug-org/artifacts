# artifacts

This repository hosts the public facing website (i.e. [https://artifact.ucaiug.io](https://artifact.ucaiug.io) to be used by the CIM community for locating profile artifacts made available by UCAIug and licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license. It is helpful in serving to centralize documentation that describes and references profile artifacts (`XSD`, `RDF`, `SHACL`, `JSON schema`, etc.) that may be spread across a wide variety of GitHub repositories and resolvable under a distinct subdomain (e.g. http://cim-profile.ucaiug.io).
